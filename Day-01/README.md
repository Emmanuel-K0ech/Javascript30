# JS Drum Kit ü•Å

This project is a JavaScript Drum Kit that allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. Each keypress triggers a specific sound (WAV file) associated with the key. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience where keypresses not only play sounds but also provide visual feedback on the screen.

## Features
- **Interactive Drum Sounds**: Press a key (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`) to play different drum sounds.
- **Visual Feedback**: The key you press will scale slightly and highlight to show which sound is being played.
- **Reset for Fast Playback**: The sound resets every time you press the same key, allowing you to replay the same drum hit quickly.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the page, including buttons and audio elements.
- **CSS**: Styling the keys and adding visual feedback.
- **JavaScript**: Handling keyboard events, playing sounds, and adding animations.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Press any of the following keys on your keyboard: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`, or `I`.
3. A drum sound will play corresponding to the key pressed.
4. The pressed key will be highlighted with a scaling effect for visual feedback.

### Keyboard-to-Sound Mapping:
- Press `A`: Plays **CLAP** sound.
- Press `B`: Plays **HIHAT** sound.
- Press `C`: Plays **KICK** sound.
- Press `D`: Plays **OPENHAT** sound.
- Press `E`: Plays **BOOM** sound.
- Press `F`: Plays **RIDE** sound.
- Press `G`: Plays **SNARE** sound.
- Press `H`: Plays **TOM** sound.
- Press `I`: Plays **TINK** sound.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. Ensure that the audio files for each drum sound are correctly linked in the HTML.
